**Python library to easily automate data fusion models (low-, mid-, high-levels)**
 
**Description**:

Additionally to modeling (by PLS, RF or SVM), the individual modeling function independently extracts the Latent Variable Scores (-based on PLS transform).

The data fusion functions are mainly powered by dictionaries where the keys represent all employed sensors (m). Then, all possible combinations ranging from 2 to m are modeled along with several performance metrics are extracted.

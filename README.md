**Python library to easily automate data fusion models (low-, mid-, high-levels)**
 
**Description**:

The purpose of this Python library is to facilitate and automate the building of ML models based on data fusion ( low-, mid-, and high-level). Towards this end, once the sources are input, all possible combinations between them are tested, as well as several performance metrics are extracted for easy interpretation of the results.
Still under development...

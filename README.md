**Python library to easily automate data fusion ML models**
 
**Description**:

The purpose of this Python library is to facilitate and automate the building of machine learning (ML) models based on data fusion ( low-, mid-, and high-level). Towards this end, once the sources are input, all possible combinations among them are tested, as well as several performance metrics are extracted for easy interpretation of the results.
Still under development...
